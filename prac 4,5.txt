practical no:4
write the program for the following:
a)find the vector matrix multiplication of rxc matrix M with column vect U
b)find matrix multipication

prac:5
write program to enter matrix and check if it is invertible if the inverse exist find the inverse

a)numpy.linalg.det()
b)numpy.linalg.inv()
1)this function is used to find to determinent 
if the determinent non 0 we can find the inverse

2)we can find the inverse of matrix with help of this
